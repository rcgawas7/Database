1) Assume there is a table called Multicust, with all of the same column definitions
as Salespeople. Write a command that inserts all salespeople with more than one
customer into this table.

-->CREATE TABLE Multicast AS
SELECT * FROM salespeople
WHERE snum IN (SELECT snum FROM customers 
GROUP BY snum
HAVING count(snum)>1);  

SELECT * FROM multicast;


2) Write a command that deletes all customers with no current orders.

-->savepoint s1;

delete from CUSTOMERS
	where cnum in (select Cnum from ORDERS
        where Cnum not in (select Cnum from CUSTOMERS));
                        
rollback to savepoint s1;

3) Write a command that increases by twenty percent the commissions of all
salespeople with total current orders above Rs. 3,000.

-->savepoint s1;

update SALESPEOPLE
	set Comm = (Comm * (20/100)) 
		where Snum in (select Snum from ORDERS
	        where Amt > 3000);

rollback to savepoint s1;

commit;

1) Write a command that will enable a user to pull orders grouped by date out of the Orders table quickly.
	
	CREATE INDEX o_order ON orders(odate);



2) If the Orders table has already been created, how can you force the onum field to be unique (assume all current values are unique)?


                 ALTER TABLE orders MODIFY onum CONSTRAINT o_pk PRIMARY KEY;



3) Create an index that would permit each salesperson to retrieve his or her orders grouped by date quickly.

	CREATE INDEX io_DATE ON orders(odate);

4) Let us assume that each salesperson is to have only one customer of a given rating, and 
that this is currently the case. Enter a command that enforces it.

	ALTER TABLE customers MODIFY rating PRIMARY KEY;
